Facilitated by our incredible volunteers, the training consisted of insightful lectures, hands-on practical exercises, and discussions of real-life cases, all designed to strengthen mental resilience.

As a component of the ""Building Mental Health Capacity Online Training"" program, our participants explored in-depth self-care techniques, learned to identify signs of burnout, and developed strategies for effective stress management.

Access to these provinces was challenging due to their mountainous nature, with landslides and rocks blocking the roads, slowing rescue efforts.

MedGlobal partnered with Faseelah and distributed food baskets to 450 households (2250 individuals) and medical supplies to first responders and a local clinic in Tafingoult (a village near Touradent) and constructed 30 robust shelters for the winter in high mountain villages. In partnership with Al Hayat Association, MedGlobal is currently sponsoring 35 surgeries for victims of the quake.

In addition, MedGlobal recently brought in USD $1.4 million of medical supplies in partnership with Association Amal Sal√® and Direct Relief to support victims of the quake in their ongoing recovery. Supplies include syringes, needles, sutures, catheters, oral rehydration salts, prenatal tablets, stethoscopes, medications used to manage and treat hypertension and PTSD and other needed medicines."

At just three months old, Hamed was in a life-threatening situation, caught amidst clashes in his neighborhood in Al Thora, Omdurman. With the nearest health facility, Al-Roomy, closed due to the ongoing conflict in Sudan, accessing urgent medical care became a daunting challenge.

In this critical moment, hope emerged from Al Nada Hospital. This MedGlobal-supported hospital bridged the gap left by the closure of many health centers in Omdurman. 

Hamed's journey was difficult. His tiny body desperately needed oxygen to survive as he battled bronchiectasis, a condition where the airways in the lungs become abnormally widened. For 24 harrowing hours in the ICU, the sounds of bombings outside, the dedicated medical team worked tirelessly to save his precious life.

Hamed's story reminds us of the resilience of the human spirit and the vital importance of accessible healthcare. Together, we can continue to make a difference in the lives of those in need.

MedGlobal has been committed to addressing oxygen needs in health facilities and enhancing healthcare infrastructure in Sudan, even amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We proudly built the largest oxygen generators in Nyala, ensuring access to emergency oxygen for over 5.3 million people.

In July 2022, Oleg Dovgan participated in a MedGlobal Sugery Trauma Training at Ternopil National Medical University. Oleg's specialization is in anesthesiology, but today he serves as a military doctor in the intensive care unit of the evacuation team, where he never expected to apply surgical skills in combat situations.

""I learned about this training on Facebook and decided to enhance my surgical skills as an anesthesiologist. I have no regrets about seizing this opportunity. These skills have proven invaluable in my role as a doctor, extending beyond my specialization,"" said Oleg Dovgan.

Today, Oleg is on the frontlines, saving lives  with injuries from explosives and bullets, often dealing with critical cases such as brain injuries, chest and abdominal wounds, and traumatic amputations.

""I owe a debt of gratitude to the MedGlobal trainers as I constantly apply what I learned from Dr Jude Slavkowski and  Dr John Sherk. Their teachings have been vital on the frontlines. I wish I could attend such training more frequently."" added Oleg.

A few months passed - and she successfully completed her internship and works as a pediatrician. She now works as a pediatrician and is set to become a child psychiatrist in September 2023. 

Anna actively applies the techniques she learned during MedGlobal‚Äôs mental health training to assist her friends and patients. The training emphasized the importance of not imposing one's opinion but guiding individuals to find their own solutions through thoughtful questioning. Anna found the principles of proper support fundamental, particularly in her medical practice, where challenging cases and patients with mental conditions are common. She also learned techniques for self-care and recognizing when one needs rest. 

Anna believes these skills will be essential in post-war Ukraine, as the country will need effective support systems. Anna hopes for more training opportunities to equip Ukrainians with mental health and support skills, which are crucial in helping those in need now in Ukraine."

The Ceramic Filters we have provided are Crystal Drops Metal Water Filter Purifiers with Ceramic Cartridges. They are high-efficiency filters with a 99.99% plus filtration rate for bacteria, cysts, and particles. The filters have a cleanable surface for prolonged life and contain an anti-bacterial formulation with silver to inhibit microbiological growth in the ceramic. They are simple to install and maintain, and we hope they will significantly enhance access to clean water for displaced families.

MedGlobal continues to improve access to clean water, distribute hygiene kits and aquatabs for water purification, and install emergency latrines for displaced families.

Governments and aid organizations have provided emergency relief camps for many years. There have been both short-term and long-term solutions. Tents are the most common form of shelter. However, studies indicate that most of existing tent shelters do not meet the comfort requirements of their occupants and barely meet their privacy, hygiene, and other vital needs. They are also costly to produce and degrade rapidly. The alarming rise in death rates and inter-camp conflict indicates the critical need to find a solution.

Together with Edinburgh Direct Aid, MedGlobal funded a pilot project to insulate refugee tents with natural, eco-friendly discarded sheep wool for temperature and humidity regulation. We are awaiting the analysis of temperature and humidity measurements before presenting them to the shelter cluster and expand the project further."

An 8 year old boy with deafness arrived to the clinic for checkups.

The patient was referred for further treatment to assess his kidney function and Dr. Patel explained to the mother about the medical care he will require given this condition.

Only 23 out of 82 essential hospitals remain partially or fully operational, with  risk of closure due to shortages of staff, supplies, water, and electricity. Even ambulances are under attack, hindering transport of patients and medical supplies. It's time to prioritize healthcare and protect those who provide it.

April 16, 2023 

MedGlobal and its partner organization, the @sudanese_american_physicians (SAPA), express grave concerns over the recent escalation of violence in Sudan, which poses a significant threat to the already dire humanitarian crisis affecting over 15 million people due to food shortages and inflation. We demand an immediate end to hostilities and call upon all parties to prioritize the safety of civilians.

The MedGlobal team and medical staff on the ground in Khartoum and Ghadaref are safe and continue to follow the situation closely. Given the increase in violence MedGlobal and SAPA share concerns about the impact, ""We are gravely concerned about the safety and well-being of civilians, healthcare personnel, and healthcare facilities now at risk due to the ongoing conflict,"" said Dr. Yaser Al-Amine, the president of SAPA. At least 83 civilians have been killed, and 1126 have been injured in the conflict, including one doctor, according to the World Health Organization.

Hospitals are running out of medical supplies and medications, patients and medical professionals are trapped in hospitals due to the fighting and blockade of roads. The MedGlobal team in Sudan has been in contact with a critical health facility that was trapped in the middle of the clashes between the Sudanese Army and Rapid Support Forces. Thankfully, staff, patients and their families were evacuated on Sunday. ‚ÄúWe appeal to the US administration and the international community to pressure both parties to stop the fighting before things spiral out of control. Sudan is a fragile country. A developing humanitarian crisis may cause a large internal and external displacement of the population, cause more suffering, and impact neighboring countries,"" said Dr. Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal.

The device is inexpensive, portable, and simple to apply with minimal maintenance. Due to these characteristics the device can be used in the home, thereby freeing up hospital beds. This has been the perfect solution to our patients in Gaza."

In the past year, the Ukrainian people have endured unimaginable suffering. 

More than 13 million Ukrainians, including 4.8 million children, have been displaced. Eight million of these individuals have been displaced throughout Europe. 

Over 17.7 million people are estimated to have required humanitarian assistance, and people across Ukraine are deprived of basic necessities; one-third of households with people with chronic medical conditions have been unable to obtain essential medications. 

The scope of this conflict has been catastrophic. 

Today, as well as every day, we stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people."

We operate two hospitals: AlRahma hospital in Darkosh, Idlib, and Shimarin hospital in Aleppo's north. Both hospitals are receiving a staggering number of trauma emergencies. 

Our two hospitals performed more than 685 surgeries, and treated 500 trauma cases so far, consumed 4200 medical supplies, and 2500 medication units. 

Our first priority was to provide logistical support to the White Helmets of the rescue team in order to expedite the rescue operation. We contributed in spare parts and in diesel to Civil Defence/White Helmets. 

We donated 30,000 liter of diesel fuel and $20,000 for repairing the machineries to the White Helmet to support ongoing Search and Rescue operations in Syria.

We continue to donate medications and medical supplies for emergency situations to hospitals such as the Odai hospital in Harem and the Darkoosh hospital in Idlib.

We operated one mobile clinic staffed by physicians and community health workers and stocked with medical consumables, medications, and nutrition supplies in order to provide health care to women, the elderly, and children who volunteered. 

Due to power outages, we also provided 2000 liters of diesel to Darkosh hospital and 2000 liters to Shimarin hospital in order to keep the hospitals operational.

Our Kansafra medical facility in Idlib is secure, as is the staff. It is operating at full capacity. 

In Turkey, we coordinated with the Turkish Health Ministry of Gaziantep, donated medications and medical supplies, and offered logistical assistance.

The northern regions of Syria, including Jenderis, Salqin, Harem, Sarmada, Aldana, and Al Atarib, are the most damaged and require huge support and immediate aid.

After examining a complaint of leishmaniasis in the right cheek by the specialist dermatologist at the center, it was found that her condition was inflammatory. The doctor quickly provided a suitable treatment to stop the infection. Then follow-up appointments were set by the practitioner to monitor the 20 day course of intramuscular treatments. Maria was very pleased after learning from the doctor that her leishmaniasis infection will disappear by the end of the treatment cycle.

With a deadly winter currently bearing down on millions of refugees and displaced persons, compounded in severity by the ongoing cholera outbreak; MedGlobal depends on the Turkey-NW Syria Bab al-Hawa border remaining open to continue supplying humanitarian aid and training programs to our many MedGlobal supported facilities and programs in Syria, including comprehensive medical, women‚Äôs health, mental health and rehabilitation services.

MedGlobal‚Äôs position will always be clear: humanitarian aid and health services must always be allowed to reach those who need it most; especially vulnerable populations who are at risk of being cut off from basic resources needed for human survival due to conflict, climate change or both.

MedGlobal urges the UN Security Council to extend resolution 2642 with their vote prior to its expiration on January 10, 2023. This will ensure that over 4 million vulnerable humans (mostly women and children) will remain valued in being given priority access to food, shelter, life-saving health services, and protected from gender-based violence and vulnerabilities of living in non-government controlled areas.

MedGlobal is an international medical NGO that provides emergency relief in disaster regions."

These healthcare services are a part of the multisectoral, extensive response launched by MedGlobal in November 2022¬†to address the needs of people in Sudan affected by flooding, economic crisis, and climate change. 

This preventive approach will have a positive effect on the health and hygiene practices of affected individuals, while building resiliency in their communities."

MedGlobal is a pioneer in introducing POCUS in emergency response systems globally. 

 As part of MedGlobal‚Äôs ongoing effort to combat the COVID19 pandemic, POCUS has been introduced in the Rohingya refugee camp.

Dr. Nahreen Ahmed, a practicing pulmonologist and MedGlobal board member has been leading this effort. In Bangladesh she has conducted hands-on POCUS training as part of the management of respiratory symptoms. 

The objective of this training was to develop the skills of healthcare providers working in camp settings to easily identify and diagnose any emergency or acute respiratory illness such pneumonia or other respiratory conditions.

This is a stepping stone towards sustaining MedGlobal‚Äôs effort to effectively curb the COVID19 pandemic.

Targeted beneficiaries of these programs in Bangladesh have been Medglobal‚Äôs Doctors in Health Post, Leda, Camp 24, Teknaf and MBC Shamitipara, and Cox‚Äôs Bazar."
