FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  July 14, 2023  MedGlobal Very Concerned by the Potential Transfer of Control over Cross-Border Humanitarian Aid Operation from UN to Assad Regime  Read Full Press Release: https://t.co/7nHHSO1IQ0 https://t.co/o189WJmBsf
MedGlobal operates several primary health clinics, hospitals, ambulance system, mental health programs, a drug rehabilitation center, medical training, nutrition, and vaccination programs that serve hundreds of thousands of mostly internally displaced people in northern Syria. https://t.co/ozMpx5i7r7
Since 2021, Russia has forced the Council to shrink  cross-border operation and threatened to let the operation shut down permanently. About 85% of that assistance arrives through the Bab al-Hawa crossing to Syria’s last opposition stronghold of Idlib, where 4.5M depend on UN aid
“How can we allow the same regime that bombed its people, used chemical weapons against children, attacked hospitals and schools, and starved children to death in areas that were under its siege...to control the aid delivery to 4.5 million people whom it has treated as enemies?”
Zaher Sahloul, the president of Medglobal spoke out on the situation, saying this "will lead to more death and suffering among innocent civilians and will trigger another refugee crisis to Türkiye and Europe by desperate Syrians.”
The UN-operated aid reaches 2.7 million Syrians monthly with life-saving aid via Bab al-Hawa. Needs have only grown over 12 years of civil war with economic crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the deadly earthquakes in February.
According to the letter sent to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UK Ambassador Barbara Woodward and circulated to council members, the access will last for six months beginning Thursday.   Half of the 4.5 million in NW Syria are internally displaced.
The Syrian Ambassador to the UN said Thursday that the Syrian government has “taken the sovereign decision to grant the United Nations and its specialized agencies permission to use Bab al-Hawa crossing…in full cooperation and coordination with the Syrian government.”
MedGlobal and other NGOs are shocked by Syrian regime's offer to manage cross-border humanitarian aid to 4.5 million NW #Syria, instead of the UN-led operations that assured the delivery of humanitarian aid since 2013. @sahloul @CNN @FoxNews @emza_ent @CBS @ABC @NBCNews @BBCWorld https://t.co/W6KOUNmWBD

The United Nations and the broader international community must act urgently to re-authorize funding and support for the Bab al-Hawa border crossing and reaffirm past resolutions and commitments.
MedGlobal’s personnel have six years of experience on the ground in northwest Syria and can attest that the international community’s ongoing support is more vital now than ever.
In allowing this support to lapse, the United Nations is abrogating responsibilities and commitments dating back to 2014, at a time when the humanitarian crisis caused by the civil war is compounded by the ongoing impacts of the recent earthquakes.
MedGlobal is deeply alarmed by today’s failure of the United Nations Security Council to extend Resolution 2672, which provides essential access and funding for humanitarian aid to Syria. https://t.co/r9K9RBRgij

“MedGlobal has tremendously helped in bridging the gap in medical disparity across the world. I am truly honored and privileged to have the opportunity provided by MedGlobal to bring my expertise from Dallas-Fort Worth to the Syrian refugee community in Lebanon."
“Through MedGlobal, I have the privilege and opportunity to provide surgical care to patients with severe disparity in medical care that would otherwise not only go untreated but who also fail to get the standard of care treatment.”
Over 77% of people in #Lebanon now live at or below the poverty line – and for the over 1.5M Syrian refugees in the country, the situation is even more dire. For #WorldRefugeeDay, @DrSuhailSharif talks about his work serving vulnerable communities in Lebanon:

“MedGlobal's efforts to improve medical care through support of local organizations, education, training, and other initiatives for the internally displaced and refugees is crucial and leads to healthier lives in devastating conditions.”
"Common themes I witnessed with the Syrian people include their resilience, compassion, intelligence, and strength, both in the young and the old."
For #WorldRefugeeDay, Sireen Jaber, MSN, RN shares her story: “In May 2023, I joined MedGlobal to work with displaced Syrians in IDP camps in Northwest Syria and Syrian refugees in Lebanon."
After over a decade of war, #Syria is home to the world’s largest refugee crisis. Over 70% of the health care workforce has been forcibly displaced from the country, and infrastructure has only worsened since the February earthquakes. #WorldRefugeeDay https://t.co/9ye0I9yVXh

“The Yemeni medical infrastructure was already quite weak and war just made it worse.  No one chooses to become a refugee or internally displaced. The Yemenis I interacted with were just trying to keep their families safe.”
“Just like the hundreds of Syrian refugees I had met prior, the internally-displaced Yemeni victims of war whom I treated in Ma'rib in 2017 had no idea that their country was about to be hurled into unspeakable violence before the war broke out.”
After over nine years of conflict, #Yemen remains the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. For #WorldRefugeeDay, MedGlobal volunteer @NourAkhrasMD talks about her work caring for internally-displaced Yemenis:
MedGlobal’s team of Colombian health professionals, along with international volunteers, delivers vital maternal and child health services. In 2020, the Comuneros Clinic attended to 20% of all displaced Venezuelan women who gave birth in Cúcuta. #WorldRefugeeDay #RefugeeDay https://t.co/n8ZROPLi5k
